## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## 1.1 Reading the data

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r cars}
df2<-vroom(file = "../data/clean_contact_data.csv") %>%

#Frequency of surface contacts

###Hypothesis 1: There are more surface contacts carried out in women only toilets than men only toilets 

Purpose of this is to analyse whether there is a difference in the frequency of surface contacts made in the different toilet settings. Does the different layouts and number of surfaces available (i.e. urinals vs toilet seats, cubicles etc.) in the toilets influence the frequency of contacts made by individuals? If there are more surfaces to be encountered when using a toilet, is the individual then touching more surfaces than they would in a different toilet layout- 
what is the difference in a man unirating in a men-only toilet and in a gender neutral toilet with regards to surface contact?

```{r}
df2 %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  group_by(experiment_id,activity,sex,toilet_type) %>%
  tally() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=toilet_type, y=n, fill=toilet_type))+
  geom_violin(draw_quantiles = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75))+
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha=0.8)+
  xlab("Toilet type")+
  ylab ("Frequency of contact")+
  hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum()+
 labs(title = "Frequency of touches in each toilet setting")
#ggsave(path = "../outputs/images",filename="frequency_of_surface_contacts_in_each_toilet_type.png",width = 10,height=15,units = "in",bg = "white")

```

#Frequency of surface contacts of each surface in different toilet types 

Here, I want to find out which surfaces the most frequently touched by participants. Are there specific surfaces that are exclusive to certain toilet settings? i.e Sanitary bins not available in men-only toilets
```{r 1.3 Frequency of contacts of each surfaces in different toilet types,fig.width=12}
df2 %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  group_by(experiment_id,activity,surface) %>%
  tally() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=surface, y=n, fill=surface))+
  geom_violin(draw_quantiles = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75))+
  #geom_jitter(width = 0.2, height= 0.1, alpha=0.8)+
  xlab("Toilet surface")+
  ylab ("Frequency of contact")+
  hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum(axis_title_size = 14)+
  coord_flip()+
  theme(legend.position = " ")+
  labs(title = "Frequency of touches at each toilet surface")

#ggsave(path = "../outputs/images",filename="frequency_of_surface_contacts.png",width = 10,height=15,units = "in",bg = "white")
  

```

###Hypothesis 2: There is a significant difference in frequency of surface contacts made during urination in women-only toilets and men-only. 


###Hypothesis 3: There is no significant difference in the frequency of contacts made during defecation in men-only and women-only toilets

###Hypothesis 4: There is no difference in the frequency of contacts made during urination and defecation in gender neutral toilets between men and women 

Here I'm looking to see whether the layout of the toilet settings and the surfaces available influences the surface contacts made during each activity. 
NOTE ON MHM: Analysis can only be made between women-only and gender neutral toilets. This is analysed further when looking at the data on the different surfaces.

#Surfaces: Which were the most frequetly touched surfaces? 

### Surface contact in men only toilets 
NOTE: Urinals are not listed: although they are significant component of the men's toilets. Does this make the toilet design with urinals a "less contacted" space?  

```{r, fig.width=12}
